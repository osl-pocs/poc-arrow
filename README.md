# Jupyter Notebooks

You can run the jupyter notebooks available here using the c kernel available here:
https://github.com/brendan-rius/jupyter-c-kernel

If you are already creating your environment with the conda/dev.yaml, you will already
have all the dependencies you need. The only piece missing is the installation of the
kernel, using the command: `$ install_c_kernel --sys-prefix`.
